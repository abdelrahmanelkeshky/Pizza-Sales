Data Analysis of Pizza Sales

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data using SQL and Power BI,
showcasing my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights.

The primary goal was to identify trends, evaluate performance, and derive meaningful conclusions that could inform business decisions.

Key Components of the Analysis:

1- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

  o Developed essential KPIs to measure sales performance, including total sales revenue, average order value, and order frequency.

  o These metrics provided a clear snapshot of the business's health.


2- Trend Visualization:

  o Utilized Power BI to create dynamic visualizations that illustrate daily and monthly order trends.

  o This allowed for easy identification of peak sales periods and seasonal variations, helping to optimize inventory and staffing.


3- Sales Analysis by Category and Size:

  o Analyzed sales data segmented by pizza category (e.g., vegetarian, meat lovers) and size (small, medium, large).

  o This analysis revealed customer preferences and highlighted which categories and sizes were driving the most revenue.


4- Top and Worst-Selling Pizzas:

  o Identified the top-performing pizzas, providing insights into popular flavors and combinations.
  o Conversely, the analysis also pinpointed underperforming items, offering opportunities for menu adjustments or promotional strategies.


Findings and Insights:

1- Sales Trends: The analysis revealed significant spikes in sales during weekends and holidays,
   indicating the need for targeted marketing campaigns during these periods.

2- Customer Preferences: The data showed a strong preference for larger pizzas, particularly in the meat lovers category,
   suggesting that promotions could focus on these items to boost sales further.

3- Menu Optimization: By identifying the worst-selling pizzas, the project provided actionable recommendations for menu refinement, 
   potentially increasing overall profitability.
